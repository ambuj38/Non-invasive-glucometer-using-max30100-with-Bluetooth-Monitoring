# Non-invasive-glucometer-using-max30100-with-Bluetooth-Monitoring
a non-invasive glucometer prototype utilizing the MAX30100 sensor, Arduino Uno, HC-05 Bluetooth module, and an I2C LCD display. Designed for remote, real-time glucose monitoring, the device estimates blood glucose levels through heart rate and oxygen saturation data processed by a linear regression model.
